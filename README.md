# Discretizing-the-Spacetime

This notebook discusses Lorentz-invariant discretizations of spacetime, how to extract a graph from them, and how to reconstruct a (discretized) metric from it.

Note -- Some interactive parts of the code involve widgets: to visualize them, you will have to run the notebook yourself.
